Level 2 of Python problems.
1)Python progam to flatten tuple of list to tuple. 
2)Convert set into tuple and tuple into set. 
3)Covert list of dictionary to tuple list.
4)Sort tuple list by nth element of tuple. 
5)Find tuple indices from other tuple list. 
6)Convert dictionary value list to dictionary list.
There are two code files - one takes a user defined input while in the other file custom input has already been provided. A screenshot is attached as demo output.

Level 3 of Python problems.
1)Write a Python program to calculate the product, multiplying all the numbers in a given tuple. 
eg)Original Tuple: (4, 3, 2, 2, -1, 18) Product - multiplying all the numbers of the said tuple: -864
2)Write a Python program to calculate the average value of the numbers in a given tuple of tuples. 
eg)Original Tuple: ((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)) Average value of the numbers of the said tuple of tuples: [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
There are two files- one with custom input as above and other with user defined input. A screenshot is attached as demo output.
